This is a vignette to describe the process to create and run a model using the aggregate model package works a new variable to the Dictionary of the package. First this vignette will touch on what to think of or keep in mind when selecting variables and conceptually setting up a model. Then the set-up and running of the model will be elaborated on step by step. 

# Choosing variables
Selecting fitting variables for the kind of output to be obtained is crucial for success. Before looking into the available data at hand (from [eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) or [edgar](https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/emissions_data_and_maps)) it makes sense to first theoretically conceptualize which type of variables, indicators, or sectors are relevant to the desired predictive outcome.  For example, aiming to create a small model to predict CO2 emissions in Austria, it makes sense to beforehand look at government statistics and other (academic) sources of research and information to identify sectors that have the largest impact on Austrian emissions.
For example, drawing on [data from the European Climate Pact on emissions in Austria by sector](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2019-10/at_factsheet_en.pdf), it would make sense to include variables on the transport industry, waste management, energy supply and use, and agriculture in the model:

![GHG emissions in Austria by sector](vignettes/GHG_emissions_Austria.png)

Sometimes, data from data compilers like ["Our World in data"](https://ourworldindata.org/) can also help in the initial phase of conceptualising a model to get an overview of overall data trends and influencing factors. For example, the graphic below identifies sectors most crucial for emission reduction on a global level: 

![Global Greenhouse Gases by Sector](vignettes/global_GHG_sector.png)

Given this graphic, it would make sense to factor in energy usage from different sectors into the model. However, since the aggregate model currently runs on quarterly and monthly data available from eurostat and edgar, there is a certain limitation to the amount of variables of use to the model. Sometimes variables identified relevant in the conceptual stage cannot be used for the model. For example, "Energy supply and use by NACE Rev. 2 activity" from eurostat would make a good variable to use in a small model predicting emissions for Austria based on the emissions of different sectors. But this variable, which would let us account for energy use based on sector, is only available on an annual basis and therefore not useful to our model. 

Hence, when selecting variables, attention should be paid to the time frequency data is collected at to only choose variables available with monthly or quarterly data accounts. Unfortunately, it is not possible to filter on eurostat for variables based on time frequency. However, usually, if not indicated otherwise, data is collected on an annual basis. As the images below show, when data is collected on monthly or quarterly basis, this is usually indicated in the name of the category the variables are stored in or the variable name itself:

![Indication of quarterly or monthly data on eurostat](vignettes/qandm.pgn)

Another option to find monthly, or quarterly data would be to search by keywords using, for example, "energy" and "monthly", in the search bar or eurostat to find variables with monthly data on energy. However, the eurostat search function will only find variables, if any exist, with the exact keywords in the name that were used in the search:

# First steps to prepare in R before creating the model
Before starting to actually create and run the model, make sure to install and load all relevant packages, as well as the latest version of the aggregate model.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggtext)
library(dplyr)
library(eurostat)


# load the latest version of the code using these steps:
# make sure that you are in the project (top right says "aggregate.model")
# also make sure you have a "Git" tab on the top right panel
# also make sure the files contain the package code (and a folder named R)
# click "Pull" on the Git tab
# make sure to have these packages installed: dplyr, tidyr, eurostat
# then execute:
devtools::load_all()
# then you should see "Loading aggregate.model"
```


# Setting up the dictionary - example of a small environmental model

After the conceptual work and selection of variables to be used in the model, a dictionary must be created for all variables that are not yet contained in the original dictionary that comes with the aggregate model package. Make sure to double check whether variables selected for the model to be created might not already exist in the initial dictionary. 

Detailed instructions on how to add variables to the existing dictionary can be found in the [vignette "Adding a new variable to the Dictionary"](https://moritzschwarz.org/aggregate.model/articles/new_variable_to_dict.html). 

The example below shows the setting up of the directory for a small rudimentary model on emissions in Austria

# Specifying the model

After the dictionary is completed, the following code should be used to specify the model by specifying which variables to use as dependent and which ones as independent variables. Again, drawing on the conceptual pre-analysis, it might be useful to draw on (scientific) reports and articles to identify which variables would best serve as independent variables for the dependent variables chosen. Based on that, the model specification will specify equations of independent variables that together will factor into the equivalent dependent variables.

In the example below, emissions from agriculture (through managed soils), transport (flight behaviour), manufactoring (industry), and housing/buildings were chosen as the four dependent variables that rudimentally make up general emissions in Austria. For each dependent variable, a set of independent variables has been selected:

```{r}
specification <- dplyr::tibble(
  type = c(
    "n",
    "n",
    "n",
    "n"
  ),
  dependent = c(
    "N2O_soils",
    "CO2_aviation",
    "CO2_Manufactoring",
    "CO2_Residential"
  ),
  independent = c(
    "ind_N2O_mm + Price_animpro + Animal_imp",
    "GDP_new + Flights",
    "Prod_Constr_Manu + Prod_Constr_Build + Lab_In_Constr +  Lab_In_Indus",
    "Elect_cons + HDD + BuildingPermits"
  )
)
specification
```


# Running the model
As soon as all relevant variables were added and the model has been specified, the "run model" function can be applied. This function can be further used for model diagnostics and forecasting.

Example using the small environmental model:
```{r}
model <- run_model(specification = specification,
                   dictionary = environment_dict,
                   inputdata_directory = "small_examples/environmental_model/", #make sure to edit this accordingly to where your model specification is stored
                   primary_source = "local",

                   # modify save_to_disk for each new country/specification
                   # this avoids having to download the same data multiple times
                   save_to_disk = "small_examples/environmental_model/Environmental_model_V2.R",

                   quiet = FALSE,
                   saturation.tpval = 0.001,
                   constrain.to.minimum.sample = FALSE)

# you can use these few lines to print a table of the model results to get some inital insides
library(modelsummary)
```

# Model diagnostics


```{r}
model_list <- lapply(model$module_collection$model, gets::as.lm)
names(model_list) <- model$module_order$dependent

modelsummary::modelsummary(
  model_list,
  coef_omit = "iis|sis",
  gof_omit = "R",
  title = "Final models run for each sub-module for the illustrative example of Austria.",
  notes = "Impulse (IIS) and Step Indicators (SIS) are not shown individually but were activated for all models.",
  stars = TRUE
)


diagnostics_model(model) %>%
  rename(Module = module,
         `Indicator Share` = indicator_share) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE, digits = 3, label = "diagnostics", caption = "Diagnostic results for each sub-module.") %>%
  kable_styling()


# show the network graph
model %>%
  network()
```



# Forecasting


```{r}
# -- Forecasting ----------
f1 <- forecast_model(model, exog_fill_method = "AR")
f2 <- forecast_model(model, exog_fill_method = "auto", plot.forecast = FALSE)

# ggsave(p, width = 7, height = 5, file = "data-raw/test_for_now/EAERE_forecast_inclexog.pdf", device = cairo_pdf)

```


# Insample Forecasting
Using insample forecasting, the validity of the model can be tested. The model assumes a specific point in time (in this example 01.01.2010) to be the last known data after which forecasting will be made until the actual present. Through this hindcasting it can be checked, how well the model can predict the future.

In the case of the small environmental model example...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Insample Forecasting ----------------------------------------------------
# Here we use hindcasts to check the validity of our model
# this takes quite a bit of time, so make sure to do this wisely (check everything before)
# then perhaps try to only use .95 for the first run
# then extend to e.g. .9 or .8 to check if the model really works

f2_insample <- forecast_insample(model, sample_share = .97, exog_fill_method = "auto")

# you can also change the exog_fill_method to e.g. "AR" or "last"
